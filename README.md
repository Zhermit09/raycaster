This is a high school project where one used a technique called raycasting to convert a 2D map into a 3D one, or at least give the illusion of it.
The project was written in JavaScript as this was a hand-in for a WebDev course.
The project should be hosted by GitHub and be accessible at https://zhermit09.github.io/raycaster/
